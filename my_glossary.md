| <a id="cardinal"></a>Cardinal categories | Order/Priority does not matter. For e.g., <br>- Color: Red, Blue, Green, etc. <br>- City: New York, London, Paris, etc. <br>- Gender: Male, Female, Non-binary. <br>- Zip code: 636373, etc. <br> - User id: ... |  
| Categorical | In ML/DL, categorical columns represents types of data that can be divided into multiple categories. For e.g., <br><br><b>[Cardinal](#cardinal) categories</b>: Order does not matter<br>- Color: Red, Blue, Green, etc. <br>- City: New York, London, Paris, etc. <br>- Gender: Male, Female, Non-binary. <br>- Zip code: 636373, etc. <br> <br> <b>[Ordinal](#ordinal) categories</b>: Order matters<br>- Temperature: Low, Medium, High <br>- Ratings: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. |
| Collaborative filtering | ... <br> For e.g.,, if customer A buys products 1 and 10, and customer B buys products 1, 2, 4, and 10, the engine will recommend that A buy 2 and 4 |
| Data augmentation | Synthetically generate variations of input data. Works well for different types of models, including images, text, etc. <br> For e.g., generating variations of input images, such as by rotating them or changing their brightness and contrast.  |
| Object detection | Recognizing where objects in an image are, and highlight their locations and name of the each found object. <br> Variants: <br> - [Segmentation](#segmentation)|
| Object recognition | Computers recognizing what items are in an image. |
| <a id="segmentation"></a>Segmentation | A variant of object detection, where every pixel is categorised based on what kind of object it's part of. Useful for self-driving vision. |
| Sparse matrix | ... <br> e.g., A company like Amazon represents very purchase that has ever been made by its customers as a giant sparse matrix. i.e., a 2D vector with rows representing users and columns representing products.  |
| <a id="ordinal"></a> Ordinal categories | Order/ranking matters. For e.g., <br>- Temperature: Low, Medium, High <br>- Ratings: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
| Out-of-domain data | Information that falls outside of the specific knowledge, context, or data set that a model has been trained on. |
